# TutorialAddOn
Learning to create and edit World of Warcraft Addons by following a tutorial.  I'll add notes for any issues I run into.

        <summary>Notes for Part 1</summary>
        * This tutorial was written for Classic and I'm doing this on Retail so, we'll see if that causes issues.
        * I found the DefaultState field while digging through existing addons' toc files.  It makes it so the addon is off by default, which I'd prefer since this is a tutorial thing.
        * Since I chose to name this "TutorialAddOn" I'll be using that name instead of "MyAddon", which is what's used in the tutorial.
        * I feel like there's going to be a lot of UI '/reload' -ing, so I'm making a macro for it in game.
